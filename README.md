# My Emacs Configuration File

This repo contains my configurations for running Emacs. Click on the Emacs.org file to see further snippet details regarding what each sections does and how the code works. It is mostly derived from System Crafter's Emacs from Scratch Series on youtube.

## What is Emacs?

It is primarily a text editor with extensive customizability. With enough customizations, one could use it as a desktop environment and never have to leave it. It is customized using various open source packages that are programmed in Elisp. Emacs is an interpreter for Elisp so you could also write your own code in Elisp and make Emacs do whatever you wish. My main motivation for using Emacs is related to its extensive flexibility, extensibility, and productivity. It helps me organize my knowledge, scheduling, and projects.
